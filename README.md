SPAM SMS DETECTION

Built an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Used techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages. In this model the Support Vector Machines is identifying the messages correctly in most of the cases while Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression lacks some concept to achieve the same as SVM.
